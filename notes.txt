/* New Javascript Syntax */

Object.create(o) // create object that inherits from o
function f() {return 42;}
var g = new f(); // create function that inherits from other function

Object.isPrototypeOf()

chaining with new vs create

Object.create --> prototype of object is first argument of the function
   prototype is the thing you called function on (created instance of)

new --> prototype is prototype of the thing you inherited. (made a copy of)
